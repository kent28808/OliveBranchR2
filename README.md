## Problem Background
The desire for human connection is a core human need.  However, when couples fight, that empathic connection to each other is temporarily lost which can lead to a further breakdown in communication. While most market offerings attempt to directly resolve the conflict, our team was curious about how effective communication techniques can help couples stay in connection with one another in these moments of disconnection. Our hypothesis, inspired by Marshall Rosenbergâ€™s Nonviolent Communication, is that helping couples re-establish an empathic connection to one another first would help them reconcile more effectively.
